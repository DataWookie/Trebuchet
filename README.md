# Trebuchet

## Background

This project was inspired by a Trebuchet constructed by Ross Kelly. Check out videos of it in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1QU1nfKZ8E "Launching view.") and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD6mgKXwC2c "Side view."). The design for his Trebuchet is loosely based on the [Pennypult](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/apptivus/pennypult-ultimate-office-toy-and-model-trebuchet) Kickstarter project. 

## Considerations

An effective Trebuchet should

- deliver a destructive projectile (large kinetic energy, which means maximising mass and speed);
- from a great distance.
