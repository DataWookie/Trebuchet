# Trebuchet

## Background

This project was inspired by a Trebuchet constructed by Ross Kelly. Check out videos of it in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1QU1nfKZ8E "Launching view.") and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD6mgKXwC2c "Side view."). The design for his Trebuchet is loosely based on the [Pennypult](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/apptivus/pennypult-ultimate-office-toy-and-model-trebuchet) Kickstarter project.

### Elementary Analysis

An elementary analysis of a projectile with specific speed launched at an angle ψ above the horizontal will achieve a maximum range if ψ is 45°. Although this is a useful starting point when analysing a trebuchet, it is far from realistic. The problem is that the speed of the projectile is changing with time, so that a launch at 45° inclination might occur before the projectile has achieved maximum possible speed.
