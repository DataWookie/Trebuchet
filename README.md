# Trebuchet

## Background

This project was inspired by a Trebuchet constructed by Ross Kelly. Check out videos of it in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1QU1nfKZ8E "Launching view.") and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD6mgKXwC2c "Side view."). The design for his Trebuchet is loosely based on the [Pennypult](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/apptivus/pennypult-ultimate-office-toy-and-model-trebuchet) Kickstarter project. 

## Model

### Elementary Analysis

If the projectile is launch with initial speed $v_0$ and an angle $\psi$ to the horizontal then it will achieve a range of
$$
R = \frac{2 v_0^2 \sin \psi \cos \psi}{g}
$$
where $g$ is gravitational acceleration.
