                        A medieval army laying siege to a fortified city had two strategies at their disposal:
                        <ol><
                        <li> destroy the city's fortifications and
                        <li> destroy the inhabitants' morale.
                        /ol>
                        <p>Both of these could be achieved with a Trebuchet.</p>

                        <p>In the first instance they would hurl massive boulders at the city walls, eventually breaching them and gaining access to the city. There would also be devastatiing loss of life in the process.</p>

                        <p>The second tactic was aimed at humuliation. The attacking army would use their Trebuchet to lob the carcasses of dead animals and loads of excrement into the besieged city. It was literally a shit-slinging contest.</p>

                    <aside class="notes">
                    The range of the Trebuchet was important so that the attacking army could stay outside the range of the defending archers' bows.

                    The Trebuchet was invented in China around 500 BC.

                    The Trebuchet developed over a period of around 1000 years, during which time it evolved significantly as a result of experimentation and innovation. The predecessors of the Trebuchet were the catapult and the ballista, both of which relied on an elastic mechanism to propel a projectile. As a result they were limited in the mass of the projectile (so they were really only suitable for human targets) as well as the accuracy which they could achieve.

                        </p>
                        <aside class="notes">
                            In the days before canons, the Trebuchet was used to hurl rocks large distances to break down stronghold walls. It has been called the <em>Atomic Bomb of the Middle Ages</em>. Howeveer, I think that it's actually more like the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricin">Ricin</a> of the Dark Ages</em>.

                            The Crimean city of Caffa was heavily fortified by two concentric walls. The inner wall enclosed 6 000 houses, while the outer wall enclosed 11 000 houses. Caffa was besieged by invading Mongol forces in 1346 (it was under seige from the Mongols a number of times prior to this as well). The city was under siege for almost 3 years. During this time the Mongol army became afflicted with The Plague. The attackers hurled the plague cadavers into the city using Catapults and Trebuchets. The objective was two-fold:
                            <ol>
                            <li> to deal with the Mongols' mortuary problem (literally "mountains of dead");</li>
                            <li> in the hope that the "intolerable stench" would kill the inhabitants of Caffa.</li>
                            </ol>
                            The cadavers would have been badly mangled in the process. Many of them would have exploded on impact, spreading the disease.
                            
                            In many ways, Caffa is was the site of one of the most spectacular incidents of biological warfare ever.
                            
                            The Black Death, which swept through Europe between 1346 and 1353, claimed claimed between a quarter and a third of the population.
                            
                            The Mongol army hurled plague-infected cadavers into the besieged city. The disease was transmitted to the inhabitants of the city, some of whom carried it elsewhere in the Mediterranean Basin, particularly to Italy.
                            
                            This is the one of the first recorded cases of biological warfare.

                            Caffa is now known as Feodosiya. It's a city on the shore of the Black Sea. It was only besieged from the land, so it could still receive supplies from sea. Also, people could escape from the city to the sea.

                    The principle of the Trebuchet is very similar that to of a lever. You have a bar which pivots around a fulcum. A force is applied to one end of the lever (by the counterweight) and this transfer a force to the projectile and the other end of the lever.

                    The power at each end of the lever must be the same. Since the velocity increases the further one gets from the fulcrum, so then the force must decrease.

                    Ideally the long arm would be roughly four times as long as the short arm; the counterweight would be roughly 100 times as massive as the projectile.

                    You'd want to fling a projectile of mass around 100 kg over a distance of at least 300 m (enough to be out of range of enemy archers).

                    These were big machines with a massive counterweight. They were, as a result, slow to operate and could only fire around twice in an hour.

                        Einstein was of the same vintage as Winston Churchill. These men had an incredible grasp of the English language. Einstein was not always very economical with his words though. This quote has often been paraphrased as "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."

                        Simple model is too simple to actually capture key features.

                        But what Einstein really meant to say was "Consider a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow">spherical cow in a vacuum</a>". Why? Well, it still looks like a cow, but it is effectively a billiard ball in a frictionless environment.
                        
                        The phrase comes from a joke that spoofs the simplifying assumptions that physics students are taught to use as they approach nearly any question:

    Q: How does a physicist milk a cow?

    A: Well, first let us consider a spherical cow...

    Or in a more detailed version:

    Milk production at a dairy farm was low, so the farmer wrote to the local university, asking for help from academia. A multidisciplinary team of professors was assembled, headed by a theoretical physicist, and two weeks of intensive on-site investigation took place. The scholars then returned to the university, notebooks crammed with data, where the task of writing the report was left to the team leader. Shortly thereafter the physicist returned to the farm, saying to the farmer, "I have the solution, but it only works in the case of spherical cows in a vacuum".

                            So it is not dissimilar to firing a bullet from a rifle, the acceleration of a Ferrari, a catapult or the propulsion of a steam locomotive. Of course, none of those are exact analogues because they all convert chemical or elastic potential energy into kinetic energy. But the underlying principle is still the same.

                            Interesting thing to note is that this is independent of the acceleration due to gravity. So a particular Trebuchet would have the same range on the Moon as it does on Earth despite the gravity being 1/6 weaker.

                            There's an army Colonel in the USA who has constructed meticulous scale-models of Trebuchets which he uses to fling small foil-wrapped packages of butter across restaurants.

                            A landowner in Shropshire built his own Trebuchet at the top of a sloping farm field and used it to hurl drums of flaming gasoline, grand pianos, dead farm animals, even a car.

                            Ross is now going to give a demonstration of his Model Trebuchet. There won't be any grand pianos or drums of flaming gasoline flying through the air. I have also made him promise that he won't use it to fling shit at you.
